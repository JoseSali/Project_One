Questions for Analysis

1. Taxes Vs Happiness. Do tax rates affect happiness/ overall well-being?
2. What are the tax trends in the five countries we chose over the 10-year span from 2009 to 2019?
3. Are stress-related deaths lower in countries with higher taxes?
4. Are stress-related deaths lower in countries with higher happiness indexes?
5. Are the top leading causes of death from stress related conditions?

Analysis Approach: 
  Maintaining individual notebooks, we analyzed the data from our respective sources. As we discussed our findings amongst our team members, we found correlations between our datasets.

Analysis:
  We began this project with the intention of discovering how different countries handle healthcare and how that affects overall wellbeing. Over the course of the project, our focus has shifted to overall happiness and the factors that play into it. We chose to focus on five countries: Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States and our data covers a 10-year span, from 2009 to 2019.
	Because our focus shifted so much over time, our datasets are seemingly disparate; however, together they form a colorful picture of what citizens in these countries experience. These countries are all considered fully developed and include some of the wealthiest in the world. This allowed us to make inferences on the correlations found in our data. 
	From our analysis, tax rates don’t have an obvious effect on the overall happiness of a country. On the contrary, the opposite appears to be true: Switzerland has both the highest tax rate and the Swiss people are the happiest. This could be because of their strong social supports- paid for by their high taxes- but might also be influenced by their mostly homogeneous culture. This might also be the reason for their longer life expectancy. 
	Perhaps it is not surprising then, that the evidence shows higher taxes do not lead to more stress related deaths. In fact, it seems to be unhappiness that leads to more stress related deaths. Countries that scored highest on the happiness index show the lowest rates of stress related death. 
We found that the general trend for tax rates has been: the US has lower overall tax rates while Germany’s taxes have increased over the 10-year period and Switzerland has the highest overall tax rate.
Although Switzerland has the highest tax rates out of all the countries in our studies, our conclusion is that Switzerland is the Happiest Haven. Switzerland showed lower overall rates of deaths, the highest GDP, the highest happiness index for life satisfaction, and longest life expectancy.
